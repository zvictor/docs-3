description: Introduction to the Apollo Data Stack.
---

Apollo is a data stack for modern apps, built with [GraphQL](https://medium.com/apollo-stack/the-basics-of-graphql-in-5-links-9e1dc4cac055#.576me0i04). It's a decoupled set of packages, including a GraphQL client, a set of tools for a GraphQL-JS server, and various client-side integrations.

We're building Apollo to be:

1. **Incrementally adoptable**, so that you can drop it into any JavaScript app
3. **Simple to get started with**, you can just read one guide and get going
4. **Inspectable and understandable**, so that you can have great developer tools to understand exactly what is happening in your app

Apollo is currently in the technical preview stage. This means there are still many features to build and bugs to iron out (check the GitHub issues for the [various repositories](https://github.com/apollostack)), but we think what we have now shows the general direction of the project, and is usable by adventurous developers who want to participate actively in the project. Give it a shot, and let us know how it goes!

## New to GraphQL?

Just getting started with GraphQL? Check out the [official documentation](http://graphql.org/), as well as [our blog post](https://medium.com/apollo-stack/the-basics-of-graphql-in-5-links-9e1dc4cac055) that can help you to get started quickly.

## Example apps

We have put together some basic example apps using various parts of Apollo; check them out to see how everything fits together. We're always looking for improvements and feedback on these apps, and they'll get better as Apollo becomes more production-ready!
